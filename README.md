# April Fool's 2018

This is an april fool's day project to redo the entire website with no "modern
web frameworks"

I was a bit inspired by [this blog post][1]. I was also inspired when I
realized how many times I had to paste "computing-resources" and variants on
our current website. It totalled to somewhere around 9, in 5 different files.

This means no Node/React, no Django, no PHP even. In fact, this webpage is
completely static.

I am using some tools like Pandoc and Sass, but I consider them not to be web
frameworks.

The tech stack is using tried and trusted Unix-y tools: Apache/Nginx serving
HTML and CSS generated via Make and Awk.

On another note, this project was done remotely over ssh using Vim, Tmux, and
Ranger. Just in case you were wondering. :)

Hope you all enjoy!
