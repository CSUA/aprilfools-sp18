The CSUA is dedicated to improving the experience of computer science
undergraduates at Berkeley. We host many types of events to bring the best of
industry together with the best in computer science talent. Our sponsors fund
some of the best resource on Berkeley's campus, from a web server, to a
high-performance computing cluster, to career and technical development
workshops that help teach students important skills for industry.
