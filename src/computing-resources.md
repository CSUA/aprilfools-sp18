Computing Resources
===================

## Desktop Machines · SSH Access · Web Hosting · GPU Computing

CSUA provides computing resources to our members. A CSUA account is required to
log in and use the machines. Any officer can help you set up an account. Come
visit our office at 311 Soda to make an account, or come to one of our General
Meetings. Questions about computing resources should be directed to
root@csua.berkeley.edu

## SSH access

Log in with your CSUA account to `soda.berkeley.edu`. There, you will find a
fairly standard, secure install of Debian. You can use soda to help host your
projects, or as a development server. If you would like some package installed,
or need help with using `soda`, don't hesistate to contact
root@csua.berkeley.edu.

## Web hosting

Place your `.html` files in your `~/public_html` directory and they will be
publicly available at `soda.berkeley.edu/~$USER`

## Desktop Machines

We have high-quality desktop machines for you to use in 311 Soda. Please note
one of our office rules: please respect the office and office equipment. Please
do not eat or drink over the computing equipment.

Our machines have been named after drinks since CSUA first christened
`soda.berkeley.edu`. Here are the names of the current desktop machines:

- Beer (connected to TV)
- Boba
- Mead
- Sake
- Scotch
- Soju
- Vodka

## GPU Computing on Latte

Thanks to donations from NVIDIA, CSUA has a GPU server available for public
use. It features 8 [NVIDIA Tesla P100 datacenter-class GPUs][1].
